# D3 Charts using Covid-19 Live Data
D3 stands for Data-Driven Documents, which is used to create a static SVG chart. It helps to draw various types of charts:
i)Bar Chart
ii)Circle Chart
iii)Pie Chart
iv)Donut Chart
v)Line Chart
vi)Bubble Chart; and many more.This project mainly focuses on Line Charts. A line chart is a type of chart which displays information as a series of dataPoints connected by straight line segments. Each dataPoint has x variable determining the position on the horizontal axis and y variable determining the position on the vertical axis.
Markers are automatically disabled when there are large number of dataPoints. You can override this behaviour by manually setting markerSize to a value greater than zero. 
Steps on how to create a line graph are as follows:
1. The HTML part of the code just creates a <div> that will be modified by D3 later on.
2. The first part of the JavaScript code sets an SVG area. It specifies the chart size and its margin. 
3. For example the data herein, shows the increase in number of Corona virus patients as the time increases.
4. Line is drawn using a path, and using the d3.line utility.
Now that the chart is made, let's know how to style it, and following are the points which should be kept in mind while doing so:
1.AXIS
2.COLORS  
3.THEMES 
4.RESPONSIVENESS
5.LEGEND

This project is about D3 examples using real life data on real scenarios.

### HACKTOBER FEST [Issues](https://github.com/mahowa/Covid-19-d3/issues):

    1.  Update this Readme with information found in the codebase
        - Something like how to create a chart
        - How to custom style a chart
    2.  Write a test
    3.  Add date range selector
    4.  Update styles
    5.  Add some more data sets
    6.  Create a chart
       - Heatmap of us
    7.  Add tool tips
    8.  Add more documentation or helpful information to the comments in the code
    9.  Make a global styles file and move styles in the index.js into that file

HINT: Look through the code. There are some notes on things that might help you get started Hacking.
